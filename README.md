# just-a-clock

This is just a react clock web app.

I was looking for an iOS app that run as a table clock for an old iPhone that I have. But they all run ads, or you have to pay to get rid of them. I am too cheap to pay 2 dollars so here comes the project.

# Device Support

Unfortunately after the app was built and I found out the old iOS version have poor support on React.js web app for some react. It just went blank after opening the site. But it should work with newer smartphone devices, both iOS and Android.

# Development

Install packages and run the app.

```shell
npm install
npm run start
```

Build the App:

```
npm run build
```

Deploy to GitHub Page 

> <!> Change `CNAME` in the `public` folder and `homepage` url in `package.json` before running the deploy command.
```
npm run deploy
```
